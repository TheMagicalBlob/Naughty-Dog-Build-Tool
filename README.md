# Naughty Dog Build Tool

Just A Tool To Increment The Build Number & *Date In The PS4 Naughty Dog Games To Keep Track While Modding Them.

This Has Offsets For Most Debug Text One Might Want To Replace Built In, But Supports Custom Offsets As Well.
Also Has Some Settings To Chose From.

*(UC2 & UC3 Lack A Build Date, So It Gets Skipped For Those Two)
